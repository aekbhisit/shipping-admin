```

### **Frontend Technology:**
```yaml
Templates: "Laravel Blade"
JavaScript: "jQuery"
CSS_Framework: "Bootstrap 5"
UI_Components: "DataTables for admin interfaces"
Approach: "Server-side rendering with jQuery enhancement"
```

### **Database & Storage:**
```yaml
Database: "MariaDB"
Optimization: "Simplicity (basic structure)"
Query_Patterns: "Normal query usage (balanced)"
Data_Retention: "Keep all data indefinitely"
File_Storage: "Local storage"
Caching: "None initially"
Queue: "None initially"
```

### **Authentication & API:**
```yaml
Authentication: "Built-in Laravel auth"
API_Scope: "Internal only (AJAX)"
Security: "Standard Laravel security features"
```

## üèóÔ∏è **DATABASE ARCHITECTURE STRATEGY:**

### **Confirmed Database Design:**
```yaml
Customer_Data_Strategy:
  approach: "Centralized customer/sender/receiver database"
  sharing: "Shared across all branches"
  benefit: "Avoid duplicates, enable cross-branch shipping"
  user_approval: "Yes"

Branch_Isolation_Strategy:
  approach: "Shipment and performance data isolated per branch"
  isolation: "Each branch sees only their shipments and reports"
  benefit: "Data privacy and branch-specific operations"
  user_approval: "Yes"

Audit_Trail_Strategy:
  approach: "Complete change tracking for compliance"
  tracking: "All changes tracked for shipping compliance"
  benefit: "Regulatory compliance and accountability"
  user_approval: "Yes"

Three_Person_Model:
  relationship: "Customer ‚Üí Sender ‚Üí Receiver ‚Üí Shipment"
  flexibility: "Customer can have multiple senders, senders have multiple addresses"
  user_approval: "Yes, and sender have multiple addresses"
```

### **Database Performance Configuration:**
```yaml
Query_Optimization: "Normal query patterns (balanced read/write)"
Indexing_Strategy: "Simple indexes for performance"
Data_Retention: "Keep all data indefinitely"
Backup_Strategy: "Standard MariaDB backup procedures"
```

## üîå **API INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE:**

### **Shipping Carrier Integration:**
```yaml
Primary_Carriers:
  - "Thailand Post"
  - "J&T Express" 
  - "Flash Express"

Integration_Priority: "All of the above"
  - Real-time quotes (immediate pricing)
  - Label generation (shipping labels)
  - Tracking integration (shipment status)

API_Reliability_Strategy:
  failure_handling: "Cache previous quotes for fallback"
  rate_limiting: "Not sure yet (to be determined)"
  monitoring: "Basic API status tracking"
```

## üéØ **CONTROLLER ARCHITECTURE:**

### **Confirmed Controller Naming Pattern:**
```yaml
ADMIN_Controllers:
  pattern: "*AdminController"
  purpose: "Administrative management functions"
  user_approval: "ok"
  examples:
    - UserAdminController: "User management for company/branch admins"
    - BranchAdminController: "Branch management for company admins"
    - ShipperAdminController: "Shipper management for company admins"
    - CustomerAdminController: "Customer management for branch admins"
    - ProductAdminController: "Product/add-on management for branch admins"
    - AuditAdminController: "Audit management for company admins"

STAFF_Controllers:
  pattern: "*Controller"
  purpose: "Operational functions and general operations"
  user_approval: "ok"
  examples:
    - LoginController: "Authentication for all user types"
    - ShipmentController: "Shipment creation for branch staff"
    - CustomerController: "Customer search/lookup for branch staff"
    - QuoteController: "Real-time quote generation for branch staff"
    - PrintController: "Label printing for branch staff"
```

## üìä **BUSINESS WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE:**

### **Confirmed 7-Step Shipment Process:**
```yaml
Step_1: "Customer Selection/Creation"
Step_2: "Sender Information"
Step_3: "Receiver Information"
Step_4: "Package Details (weight, dimensions)"
Step_5: "Service Selection (express, standard)"
Step_6: "Rate Comparison & Selection"
Step_7: "Payment & Confirmation"

User_Approval: "ok"
Modifications: "no need modify"
Implementation: "Single-page progressive form with session storage"
```

## üöÄ **MODULE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY:**

### **Core Business Modules Identified:**
```yaml
Foundation_Modules:
  - User: "Extend existing - authentication and role management"
  - Branch: "New - multi-branch operations and rate management"
  - Customer: "New - centralized customer/sender/receiver management"

Business_Modules:
  - Shipment: "New - core shipping operations and 7-step workflow"
  - Shipper: "New - API integration for Thailand Post, J&T, Flash"
  - Product: "New - product categories and add-on management"

Compliance_Modules:
  - Audit: "New - compliance tracking and audit trails"
```

### **Module Generation Approach:**
```yaml
Generation_Tool: "dev/module-framework"
Base_Pattern: "Follow existing User module architecture"
Technology_Consistency: "Apply finalized technology stack to all modules"
Controller_Naming: "STRICT AdminController pattern enforcement"
Database_Design: "MariaDB with simple indexing strategy"
UI_Consistency: "Bootstrap 5 + DataTables + jQuery across all modules"
```

## ‚úÖ **READY FOR MODULE DEVELOPMENT:**

### **Architecture Status:**
```yaml
Technology_Stack: "‚úÖ Finalized"
Database_Strategy: "‚úÖ Confirmed"
API_Integration: "‚úÖ Planned"
Controller_Naming: "‚úÖ Approved"
Business_Workflow: "‚úÖ Validated"
Module_Strategy: "‚úÖ Defined"
```

### **Next Phase Actions:**
```yaml
1. "Generate individual module requirements using module-framework"
2. "Follow User module pattern for consistency"
3. "Apply technology stack decisions to all modules"
4. "Implement AdminController naming pattern"
5. "Create modules following finalized architecture"
```
