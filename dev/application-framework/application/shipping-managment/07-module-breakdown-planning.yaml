  level_2: ["Branch"] # Depends on User
  level_3: ["Customer", "Shipper", "Product"] # Depends on User + Branch
  level_4: ["Shipment"] # Depends on Customer + Shipper + Product
  level_5: ["Audit"] # Depends on all others

development_sequence:
  phase_1: ["User", "Branch"]
  phase_2: ["Customer", "Shipment"] # Start Shipment after Customer basics
  phase_3: ["Shipper", "Product"] # Can develop in parallel
  phase_4: ["Audit"] # Implement after core business logic
```

## üéØ **TECHNOLOGY CONSISTENCY ACROSS MODULES:**

### **Enforced Standards:**
```yaml
backend: "Laravel 8.12 with nwidart/laravel-modules"
frontend: "Blade templates + jQuery"
database: "MariaDB with simple indexing"
ui_framework: "Bootstrap 5"
admin_tables: "DataTables for all admin interfaces"
controller_naming: "AdminController pattern STRICTLY ENFORCED"
repository_pattern: "Interface-based repositories"
```

### **Module Generation Approach:**
```yaml
generation_tool: "dev/module-framework"
base_template: "Follow existing User module architecture"
consistency_requirements:
  - "Apply finalized technology stack to all modules"
  - "STRICT AdminController pattern enforcement"
  - "MariaDB with simple indexing strategy"
  - "Bootstrap 5 + DataTables + jQuery across all modules"
  - "Repository pattern with interface contracts"
```

## ‚úÖ **NEXT STEP AFTER YOUR CONFIRMATION:**

**After you confirm this module breakdown, I will:**

1. **Generate Individual Module Requirements** for each module using `dev/module-framework`
2. **Create detailed module-requirements-basic.yaml** for each of the 7 modules
3. **Follow your technology stack decisions** (Laravel 8.12, Blade + jQuery, MariaDB, Bootstrap 5)
4. **Implement AdminController naming pattern** strictly
5. **Maintain consistency** with your finalized architecture
